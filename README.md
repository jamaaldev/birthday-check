### What is For This Package Do For You At The Moment:<br>
 you need to calculate the user's date of birth from today. It will return how many days left from now on or 1 day left or today is your birthday also Age, and how many Days Gone from birthday you can customize the Text as I already mentioned it above.<br>


#### Note: This is For Browser Javascript Vanilla Tag Element and ClassName,

```
 birthDay.DaysToBirthDay(user.DOB,'15','h1','customClass')
```
```
 birthGone.DaysGoneBirthDay(user.DOB,'45','h1','customClass')
```
## For Reactjs <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" alt="react" width="40" height="40"/> Choose your Tag Element ðŸŽ‰:<br> 

```
  <h1>
    {birthDay.DaysToBirthDay(user.DOB,'15')}
  </h1>

```
```
  <h1>
    {birthGone.DaysGoneBirthDay(user.DOB,'15')}
  </h1>

```
#### This is how you can use in Reactjs to Refresh The Birthday

```
  const [birth,setBirth] = useState('')
  const [CurrentDate, setCurrentDate] = useState(new Date())
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const birthDay = new DaysToCome('')
    setTimeout(() => setCurrentDate(new Date()), new Date().getDate());
    setBirth(birthDay.DaysToBirthDay('2000-12-4','15'))
  }, [CurrentDate]);


```

### user.DOB: string (2000-10-05)<br>

### '15' string or number:<br>
you can change different number this will help you to show how many days you want to remind the user it will calculate from now date to his/her days to come to their birthday date #Note: if empty or 0 only show today is your birthday, if there is a any user birthday is today.<br>

### This is for JS Vanilla Browser to use
#### 'h1' <br>
you can use any Tag element Note :ear: This is good when you use for loop in javascript vanilla if you wrap your own tag you may see an empty background if there is no data so it is better to use my solution only in javascript vanilla. This solution you don't need in ReactJs 
### This is for JS Vanilla Browser to use
### 'customClass': <br>
you can add a custom class with h1 or any Tag you choose.<br>
